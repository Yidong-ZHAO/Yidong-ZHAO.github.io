<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! My name is Yidong Zhao (赵忆冬). I am an incoming Postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich, working with [Prof. Johan Gaume](https://alpinemassmovements.ethz.ch/people/professor-johan-gaume.html) at [the Chair of Alpine Mass Movements](https://alpinemassmovements.ethz.ch/).

I graduated from KAIST Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, supervised by [Prof. Jinhyun Choo](https://www.choogroup.org/jinhyun-choo) at [KAIST Geomechanics Lab](https://www.choogroup.org/). I was also fortunate to visit [UCLA Artificial Intelligence & Visual Computing Laboratory](https://www.math.ucla.edu/aivc/) supervised by [Prof. Chenfanfu Jiang](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~cffjiang/index.html). I spent 2.5 years at the University of Hong Kong as a former Ph.D. student. After that, I transferred with my supervisor. I obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees both from Tongji University in 2016 and 2019, respectively.

<!-- My research interests include large deformation simulation, contact mechanics, and data-driven modeling. -->
